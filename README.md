Pouyan is a Tepel teenager who has decided to lose weight by playing chess.

Pouyan borrowed a chessboard and its pieces from the chess greats to play sports. But he found that the number of chess pieces he was given was incorrect, some more, and some less than necessary.



Be. Pouyan can increase or decrease his number of beads to get the right number. By entering the number of beads that Pouyan has of any kind, tell him how many pieces Pouyan of each type must prepare or remove in order to make a set of beads.
Entrance

In the only entry line there are 6 numbers, which are equal to the number of pieces of Pouyan chess, respectively.
Output

Only the output row should contain 6 numbers, which is equal to the number of beads of the said types that Pouyan must prepare or remove, in the same order as the input. If Pouyan has to get xxx from the beads, the number xxx should be in the position related to that bead, and if he has to remove xxx from the beads, the number −x-x − x should be in this position.
